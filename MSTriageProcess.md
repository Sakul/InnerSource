## Feature requests
1. When received a new feature issue, marks the issue with `enhancement` label (move these issues into the `Next Sprint Planning` milestone)
1. If we think the feature request is not aligned with our goals, we may choose to close it immediately
	* We may choose to collect more feedback before acting on the issue. In these situations we will move the issue in the `Backlog` so that we can review it during the release planning.

## Bug reports
1. Apply the `bug` label to the issue
1. Try to make a call regarding it's impact and severity
	* **Critical** - include it in our current milestone for immediate handling
	* **High impact** - move the issue into the **Next Sprint Planning**
	* **Unclear impact** - move it to the **Backlog**

## Investigations
Some issues may not immediately clear whether a specific issue reported is a bug or not. In these situations we will apply the `investigate` label to the issue

## Documentation requests
Some issues turn out to indicate user confusion around how to configure different aspects of the framework. When we determine such issues, we will mark these with the `Docs` label and move them into the Next Sprint Planning milestone to handle at a later time. The goal here will be to fill in the gaps or clarify our documentation, so that customers can be successful by using the guidance provided in the documentation
